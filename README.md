Neonates are classified as children in the first 4 weeks of their lives. At this early stage of their lives, vitals such as their heart and respiratory rates are important clinical indicators to monitor their status as newborns. The heart rate of infants requires resuscitation within the first few minutes of birth is known to be an estimator of early neonatal mortality and potentially severe brain injury in those who survive. Hence, an accurate assessment of heart rate at birth is crucial in guiding further interventions such as effective resuscitation efforts.

Several known methods of measuring heart rate in neonates, are electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry. These methods typically involve attaching many devices to the neonates, resulting in rather intrusive methods. Despite being the more accurate method of heart rate evaluation, ECG is also observed to have its limitations when applied to neonates such as the possibility of damaging the skin of extremely premature infants and requiring clinician experience to operate optimally.

In this project, you will investigate the possibility of estimating heart rate directly from the respiratory signal based on the knowledge that there exists a correlation between respiration and heart in neonates.
